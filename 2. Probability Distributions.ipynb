    "<b>1. Bernoulli Distribution</b><br>\n",
    "All you cricket junkies out there! At the beginning of any cricket match, how do you decide who is going to bat or ball? A toss! It all depends on whether you win or lose the toss, right? Let’s say if the toss results in a head, you win. Else, you lose. There’s no midway.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bernoulli distribution has only two possible outcomes, namely 1 (success) and 0 (failure), and a single trial. So the random variable X which has a Bernoulli distribution can take value 1 with the probability of success, say p, and the value 0 with the probability of failure, say q or 1-p.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the occurrence of a head denotes success, and the occurrence of a tail denotes failure.\n",
    "Probability of getting a head = 0.5 = Probability of getting a tail since there are only two possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability mass function is given by:<br> \n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    "p^{x}(1-p)^{1-x} \\quad where\\;x\\in (0, 1)\n",
    "\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probabilities of success and failure need not be equally likely, like the result of a fight between me and Undertaker. He is pretty much certain to win. So in this case probability of my success is 0.15 while my failure is 0.85\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the probability of success(p) is not same as the probability of failure. <br>\n",
    "Here, the probability of success = 0.15 and probability of failure = 0.85. The expected value is exactly what it sounds. If I punch you, I may expect you to punch me back. Basically expected value of any distribution is the mean of the distribution. The expected value of a random variable X from a Bernoulli distribution is found as follows:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(X) = 1*p + 0*(1-p) = p$$<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of a random variable from a bernoulli distribution is:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(X) = E(X²) – [E(X)]² = p – p² = p(1-p)$$<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many examples of Bernoulli distribution such as whether it’s going to rain tomorrow or not where rain denotes success and no rain denotes failure and Winning (success) or losing (failure) the game.<br><br>\n",
    "<b>2. Uniform Distribution</b><br>\n",
    "When you roll a fair die, the outcomes are 1 to 6. The probabilities of getting these outcomes are equally likely and that is the basis of a uniform distribution. Unlike Bernoulli Distribution, all the n number of possible outcomes of a uniform distribution are equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable X is said to be uniformly distributed if the density function is:<br>\n",
    "$$\\begin {equation}\n",
    "f(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\quad for -\\infty<a\\leq x\\leq b<\\infty\n",
    "\\end {equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the shape of the Uniform distribution curve is rectangular, the reason why Uniform distribution is called rectangular distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a Uniform Distribution, a and b are the parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of bouquets sold daily at a flower shop is uniformly distributed with a maximum of 40 and a minimum of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s try calculating the probability that the daily sales will fall between 15 and 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that daily sales will fall between 15 and 30 is (30-15)*(1/(40-10)) = 0.5\n",

    "The standard uniform density has parameters a = 0 and b = 1.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3. Binomial Distribution</b>\n",
    "Suppose that you won the toss today and this indicates a successful event. You toss again but you lost this time. If you win a toss today, this does not necessitate that you will win the toss tomorrow. Let’s assign a random variable, say X, to the number of times you won the toss. What can be the possible value of X? It can be any number depending on the number of times you tossed a coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only two possible outcomes. Head denoting success and tail denoting failure. Therefore, probability of getting a head = 0.5 and the probability of failure can be easily computed as: q = 1- p = 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "A distribution where only two outcomes are possible, such as success or failure, gain or loss, win or lose and where the probability of success and failure is same for all the trials is called a Binomial Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcomes need not be equally likely. Remember the example of a fight between me and Undertaker? So, if the probability of success in an experiment is 0.2 then the probability of failure can be easily computed as q = 1 – 0.2 = 0.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each trial is independent since the outcome of the previous toss doesn’t determine or affect the outcome of the current toss. An experiment with only two possible outcomes repeated n number of times is called binomial. The parameters of a binomial distribution are n and p where n is the total number of trials and p is the probability of success in each trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the basis of the above explanation, the properties of a Binomial Distribution are\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>4.Normal Distribution</b><br>\n",
    "Normal distribution represents the behavior of most of the situations in the universe. The large sum of (small) random variables often turns out to be normally distributed, contributing to its widespread application. Any distribution is known as Normal distribution if it has the following characteristics:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>The mean, median and mode of the distribution coincide.</li>\n",
    "<li>The curve of the distribution is bell-shaped and symmetrical about the line x=μ.</li>\n",
    "<li>The total area under the curve is 1.</li>\n",
    "<li>Exactly half of the values are to the left of the center and the other half to the right.</li>\n",

    "$$ f(x) = \\frac {1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>5. Poisson Distribution</b><br>\n",
    "Suppose you work at a call center, approximately how many calls do you get in a day? It can be any number. Now, the entire number of calls at a call center in a day is modeled by Poisson distribution. Some more examples are\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of emergency calls recorded at a hospital in a day.\n",
    "The number of thefts reported in an area on a day.\n",
    "The number of customers arriving at a salon in an hour.\n",
    "The number of suicides reported in a particular city.\n",
    "The number of printing errors at each page of the book.\n",
    "You can now think of many examples following the same course. Poisson Distribution is applicable in situations where events occur at random points of time and space wherein our interest lies only in the number of occurrences of the event.\n",

    "A distribution is called Poisson distribution when the following assumptions are valid:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Any successful event should not influence the outcome of another successful event.</li>\n",

    "<li>The probability of success in an interval approaches zero as the interval becomes smaller.</li>\n",
    "</ol><br>\n",
    "Now, if any distribution validates the above assumptions then it is a Poisson distribution. Some notations used in Poisson distribution are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lambda$ is the rate at which an event occurs,\n",
    "t is the length of a time interval,\n",
    "And X is the number of events in that time interval.\n",
    "Here, X is called a Poisson Random Variable and the probability distribution of X is called Poisson distribution.\n",

    "<b>6. Exponential Distribution</b><br>\n",
    "Let’s consider the call center example one more time. What about the interval of time between the calls ? Here, exponential distribution comes to our rescue. Exponential distribution models the interval of time between the calls.\n",

    "Variance $$Var(X) = \\frac {1}{\\lambda^2}$$\n",

    "Also, the greater the rate, the faster the curve drops and the lower the rate, flatter the curve. \n",
    "To ease the computation, there are some formulas given below.\n",
